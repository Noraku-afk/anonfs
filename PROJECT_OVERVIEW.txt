PROJECT OVERVIEW: CONFIDENTIAL FILE SHARING SYSTEM

This project is a Secure Confidential File Sharing System designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, even if the server itself is compromised.

=========================================
1. HOW IT WORKS (THE CORE LOGIC)
=========================================
- Upload: When you upload a file, the system doesn't just save it. It immediately scrambles the file using AES-256 Encryption (military-grade encryption) using a secret key stored only on the server.
- Storage: The file sitting on the hard drive (or cloud storage) is completely unreadable. If a hacker broke into your server and copied all the files, they would essentially steal "garbage" data that they cannot open.
- Download: When a user clicks download, the system first checks if they have permission. If yes, it fetches the encrypted file, unlocks (decrypts) it *in memory* for that split second, and sends the readable file to the user.

=========================================
2. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM "NORMAL" FILE SHARING
=========================================

[STORAGE]
- Normal System: Files are often stored as plain text (e.g., "report.pdf" is saved as "report.pdf").
- Confidential System (Yours): Files are stored as encrypted blobs (e.g., "uuid.enc"). No one (not even the admin) can read them directly from the disk.

[SECURITY FOCUS]
- Normal System: Focuses on sharing links and ease of access. Often uses public links.
- Confidential System (Yours): Focuses on Confidentiality. There are no public links. You must be logged in and explicitly authorized to access a file.

[SERVER BREACH SCENARIO]
- Normal System: If the server is hacked, all user files are exposed.
- Confidential System (Yours): If the server is hacked, the files remain encrypted and secure (assuming the hacker doesn't also get your encryption keys).

[USE CASE]
- Normal System: Sharing holiday photos, public documents.
- Confidential System (Yours): Sharing trade secrets, medical records, or sensitive legal documents.
